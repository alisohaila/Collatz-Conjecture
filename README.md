# Collatz-Conjecture

The Collatz Conjecture: an unsolved problem in mathematics. 

Basically, the theory states that if you pick any nautural number from 1 till infinity, and divide by 2 if it's even, or multiply by 3 and add 1 if it's odd, it would still return back to the number 1 - no matter how large your initial choice was. 

I decided to code it out (it's easy though) to test large input values and see if even a trillion gets back to 1; and yes, even it does get stuck in this "4, 2, and 1" loop.
